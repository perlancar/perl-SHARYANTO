# ABSTRACT: SHARYANTO's temporary namespace for various libraries

=head1 FAQ

=head2 What is this? Why SHARYANTO::*?

The SHARYANTO namespace is used by me for B<temporary> placeholder for modules
that are either alpha quality, unstable, lacking tests and/or documentation, or
that haven't found a proper name yet.

I put such modules on CPAN because some of my other modules (and scripts) depend
on it.

To reiterate, this namespace is for temporary placeholder and not for vanity :)
